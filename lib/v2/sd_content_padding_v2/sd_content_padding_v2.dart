///   bar, so it is measured from the bar's bottom edge, not the viewport);

///   clear of the floating nav pill the content scrolls behind;
/// - **[horizontal] either side.**
///
/// The device insets live HERE, not in `SdScaffoldV2`: a scaffold that wrapped
/// its body in a `SafeArea` would silently fight every screen that also has
/// to pad for something floating over it, and the two would double up. One
/// class computes it, every screen reads it, nothing adds it twice.

/// pill sits [navBarOffset] off the bottom edge and the log flow's step bar
