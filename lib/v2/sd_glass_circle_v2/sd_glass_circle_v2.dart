/// Wraps a single small chrome element — an icon button, a back arrow — in
/// its own frosted Liquid Glass circle. Falls back to plain [child] when
/// [SdGlassV2.isSupported] is off, so every caller can use this
/// unconditionally instead of re-deriving that check itself.
///
/// For icons sitting on anything that is not itself a [LiquidGlass] surface:
/// the app bar's blurred strip ([SdAppBarV2]'s leading/icon actions) or a flat
/// opaque panel (a bottom sheet's [AppSheetHeader]). Both leave real
/// background under the circle to refract. Do NOT use it inside something
/// that IS already a [LiquidGlass] surface — the paywall's own header —
/// because nesting one glass layer in another has nothing left to catch the
/// light and just reads as flat.
